## Arduino Software for Button/Volume/Tune control
Software handles 2 rotary encoders with button ability and 4 buttons with integrated LED's

* Rotary Encoder 1: Volume and Mute
* Rotary Encoder 2: Tuning and Menue
* Button 1: memory Button for stored stream
* Button 2: memory Button for stored stream
* Button 3: memory Button for stored stream
* Button 4: memory Button for stored stream

Due the lack of more pins (2 pins are used by I2C, pin 8 is broken and pin 13 is internal LED) we only have 4 memory buttons.
